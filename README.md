# Hyperparameter-Tuning-with-Keras-Tuner

This repository consists of the project code and other details which I learnt from coursera project network.

In this project, I learned to use Keras Tuner to find optimal hyperparamters for a Keras model. Keras Tuner is an open source package for Keras which can help machine learning practitioners automate Hyperparameter tuning tasks for their Keras models.
